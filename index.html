<h2>Military Life</h2>
<p>I served in the <strong>United States Air Force</strong>. During my time in the <strong>United States Air Force</strong>,I was a Security Forces (military police) member.
    I spent most of my time doing <em><span style="color: red;">nuclear security</span></em>. I became a certified Senior Entry Controller of a <span style="color: green;"> multi-billion dollar facility</span>
    at the rank of E-3. This duty is normally carried out by the rank of E-4 and E-5. I also received training in law enforcement and responded to alerts and incidents.
    At the time of my Honorable discharge my rank was E-4 Senior Airman.</p>

<h2>Civilian Life</h2>
<p>I spent most of my active duty life and my civilian life learning. I find nothing more thrilling
engaging with people for the sake of furthering our education. Once I was seperated from the military
I could not escape my desire to learn. I made sure to sure as much of the Gi Bill as I could. A few
of the schools I went to:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cuyahoga Community College</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Arapahoe Community College</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Aurora Community College</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Community College of the Air Force</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Central New Mexico Community College</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Great Lakes Truck Driving School</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Ohio Technical College-PowerSport Institute</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Heavy Construction Academy</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>Although I have had a lot of training and received many certificates I have no formal degree. I like to consider myself
    a Professional Student. I have always enjoyed the school setting and being in an environment of learning. Learning is a <strong>Top</strong>
    priority in my life, but gaming will always be my first true love.â™¥</p>
