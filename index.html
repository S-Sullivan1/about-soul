  <h1>My Life</h1>
</header>

<h2>Military Life</h2>
  <p> I served in the <strong>United States Air Force</strong>. During my time in the <strong>United States Air Force</strong>,I was a Security Forces (military police) member.
    I spent most of my time doing <em><span style="color: red;">nuclear security</span></em>.<br> I became a certified Senior Entry Controller of a <span style="color: green;"> multi-billion dollar facility</span>
    at the rank of E-3. This duty is normally carried out by the rank of E-4 and E-5.<br>I also received training in law enforcement and responded to alerts and incidents.<br>Weapons I have been trained on are as follows:

  <ul>
      <li>M4</li>
      <li>M9</li>
      <li>M16</li>
      <li>M203</li>
      <li>M249</li>
      <li>M240B</li>

  </ul>

    At the time of my Honorable discharge my rank was E-4 Senior Airman.</p>

  <h2>Civilian Life</h2>
  <p>I spent most of my active duty life and my civilian life learning.<br>I find nothing more thrilling
engaging with people for the sake of furthering our education. Once I was seperated from the military
I could not escape my desire to learn. I made sure to sure as much of the Gi Bill as I could.<br>A few
of the schools I went to:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cuyahoga Community College</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Arapahoe Community College</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Aurora Community College</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Community College of the Air Force</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Central New Mexico Community College</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Great Lakes Truck Driving School</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Ohio Technical College-PowerSport Institute</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Heavy Construction Academy</strong></li>

</ul>

  <p>Although I have had a lot of training and received many certificates, I have no formal degree. I like to consider myself
    a Professional Student. I have always enjoyed the school setting and being in an environment of learning.<br> Learning is a <strong>Top</strong>
    priority in my life, but gaming will always be my first true love.â™¥</p>
